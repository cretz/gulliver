* Source mapping
  * Maybe develop source map and do asm-run to replace debug symbols w/ mapped lines/filenames
  * Maybe use the JDT compiler instead
* Add more Swift spec and Gulliver-specific spec
* Utilize JDT/Eclipse search engine to find referenced classes
* Make API for defining compile-time code generation for standard library stuff
* Decide whether to target Java 8 and include retrolamda, or do my own Java version target during generation
